This project is Micro Controller Based System Design Lesson Project and I tried to make a simulation of basic LightHouse.

Usage of program is realy easy . When we start simulation , lights will be on continuously via timers. If we pressed the button,
all the lights will be open via ISR .  

If the red light is on , it means that we are in ISR . If pressed the button again , system returns from ISR and work normally.
